 * The GPU has separate, incoherent caches for the render cache and the
 * sampler cache, along with other caches.  Usually data in the different
 * caches don't interact (e.g. we don't render to our driver-generated
 * immediate constant data), but for render-to-texture in FBOs we definitely
 * do.  When a batchbuffer is flushed, the kernel will ensure that everything
 * necessary is flushed before another use of that BO, but for reuse from
 * different caches within a batchbuffer, it's all our responsibility.

    * at a time.
    *
    * Even though it's not obvious, this can easily happen in practice.
    * Suppose a client is blending on a surface with sRGB encode enabled on
    * gen9.  This implies that you get AUX_USAGE_CCS_D at best.  If the client
    * then disables sRGB decode and continues blending we will flip on
    * AUX_USAGE_CCS_E without doing any sort of resolve in-between (this is
    * perfectly valid since CCS_E is a subset of CCS_D).  However, this means
    * that we have fragments in-flight which are rendering with UNORM+CCS_E
    * and other fragments in-flight with SRGB+CCS_D on the same surface at the
    * same time and the pixel scoreboard and color blender are trying to sort
    * it all out.  This ends badly (i.e. GPU hangs).
    *
    * To date, we have never observed GPU hangs or even corruption to be
    * associated with switching the format, only the aux usage.  However,
    * there are comments in various docs which indicate that the render cache
    * isn't 100% resilient to format changes.  We may as well be conservative
    * and flush on format changes too.  We can always relax this later if we
    * find it to be a performance problem.
