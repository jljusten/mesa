Hello friends!  I see you finally found us. :)  Expect more details next
month at XDC 2018, "Reimagining i965"/"Optimizing i965 for the Future"...

Piglit details
--------------

Run with -x timer_query to avoid hardlocks in
"ext_timer_query-time-elapsed timestamp -auto"
(nope, still broken, even with timer queries implemented...) :(

To Do
-----

Anywhere // appears in the code base, that is a TODO comment.
(Only C style comments should remain!)

- Set ctx->Const.QueryCounterBits.Time* to 36 (or change...)
- GPU reset detection, flag dirty = ~0ull, etc.

- DRI3 explicit fencing
- Compute shaders (Jordan has a WIP branch)
- Fence implementation (not started, may need seqno tracking, or drm syncobjs)
- Conditional rendering (not started)
- Compare extensions list for more missing things

- Gen8, Gen10, Gen11 support (not started)

- Make sure scissoring/viewport extents are getting limited to the FBO

- Auxiliary surfaces (not started - Nanley has ideas)

- Compact binding tables for SSBOs/atomics (currently wasteful)

- Shader Precompiles
- Shader Disk Cache

- u_threaded_context (Kayden has a WIP branch)

- BLORP in a separate render batch (someday)
- Stencil PMA (not started)

- Transform feedback info from st/nir is crazy (the wrong stage!)

- Gallium doesn't support separate Z and S surfaces...i965 does...
  AMD can't do them, NVIDIA apparently disallows Z24 + S8...

  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/blob/master/src/gallium/include/pipe/p_state.h#L373

- Use R32G32B32 and promote to R32G32B32X32 on first render?

- PBO upload in Gallium may be inefficient
  - We seem to get R32G32B32A32_FLOAT temporaries for upload
  - ickle says u_default_texture_subdata does a double copy

- ReadPixels with GL_STENCIL_INDEX and a GL_DEPTH_STENCIL buffer
  falls back to software even though we could totally blit

- CopyImage goes through a pile of st code, to eventually land in blit().
  Don't want this.  Just want it to call blorp_copy right away.  See:
  https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2015-July/089387.html

- Use util_try_blit_via_copy_region in iris_blit?

- Fix isl_tiled_memcpy streaming loads - ickle says it isn't recognizing
  the proper streaming function, so it's not working.
