- Compact binding tables for SSBOs/atomics

- u_threaded_context
- BLORP in a separate render batch...

- PBO upload in Gallium is inefficient
- We seem to get R32G32B32A32_FLOAT temporaries for upload
- ickle says u_default_texture_subdata does a double copy

- ickle notes that replacing binder on each batch is causing us to recycle
  active addresses, causing stalls:

  - 2.91% i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl
  - 2.89% i915_gem_do_execbuffer
  - 2.69% eb_lookup_vmas
  - 2.66% __i915_vma_do_pin
  - 2.56% i915_gem_gtt_reserve
  - 2.56% i915_gem_evict_for_node
  - 2.51% i915_vma_unbind
  - 2.42% i915_request_wait

- arb_vertex_attrib_64bit - iris_set_vertex_elements() is getting called
  with num_inputs == 5 when it should be 3.  The issue is that
  vs_dual_locations is set in the NirOptions, causing nir_gather_info
  to count each dual slot value as two bits instead of one in the
  double_inputs_read bitfield, which then causes st_program.c to
  quad count those inputs instead of double count them.
