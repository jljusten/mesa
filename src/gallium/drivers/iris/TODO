Anywhere // appears in the code base, that is a TODO comment.
(Only C style comments should remain!)

- Unjam DRI3 (glxgears stops, runs out of backbuffers and waits forever)
- Compute shaders (Kayden has a WIP branch)
- Separate stencil (Kayden has a WIP branch)
- Seqno tracking system (ickle has a WIP branch)
- Fence implementation (not started, may need seqno tracking, or drm syncobjs)
- Turn binder into a ring buffer (needs seqno, ickle has a WIP branch)
  (Until this happens we hit stalls recycling active addresses.)
- Queries (not started - needs seqno tracking?)
- Conditional rendering (not started - needs queries)

- Gen8, Gen10, Gen11 support (not started)

- arb_vertex_attrib_64bit - iris_set_vertex_elements() is getting called
  with num_inputs == 5 when it should be 3.  The issue is that
  vs_dual_locations is set in the NirOptions, causing nir_gather_info
  to count each dual slot value as two bits instead of one in the
  double_inputs_read bitfield, which then causes st_program.c to
  quad count those inputs instead of double count them.

- Auxiliary surfaces (not started - Nanley has ideas)
- Do proper pre-draw resolves/flushes (drop PIPE_CONTROLs in iris_draw.c)

- Compact binding tables for SSBOs/atomics (currently wasteful)

- u_threaded_context (not started)

- BLORP in a separate render batch (someday)
- Stencil PMA (not started)

- PBO upload in Gallium may be inefficient
  - We seem to get R32G32B32A32_FLOAT temporaries for upload
  - ickle says u_default_texture_subdata does a double copy

- ReadPixels with GL_STENCIL_INDEX and a GL_DEPTH_STENCIL buffer
  falls back to software even though we could totally blit
