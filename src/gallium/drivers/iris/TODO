- Compute shaders
- Separate stencil
- Multisampling bugs
- Auxiliary surfaces
- PMA
- Compact binding tables for SSBOs/atomics

- u_threaded_context
- BLORP in a separate render batch...

- PBO upload in Gallium is inefficient

- arb_vertex_attrib_64bit - iris_set_vertex_elements() is getting called
  with num_inputs == 5 when it should be 3.  The issue is that
  vs_dual_locations is set in the NirOptions, causing nir_gather_info
  to count each dual slot value as two bits instead of one in the
  double_inputs_read bitfield, which then causes st_program.c to
  quad count those inputs instead of double count them.
