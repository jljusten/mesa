    * arrange the buffer to placed at that address (trying to balance
    * the cost of buffer migration versus the cost of performing

    * or report a failure if we specified a conflicting offset, at our chosen
    * offset by specifying EXEC_OBJECT_PINNED.

    * system. On a shared system, our buffers have to contend for address
    * space with both aperture mappings and framebuffers and so are more
    * likely to be moved. On a full ppGTT system, each batch exists in its
