 *  Write synchronization is a special case of end-of-pipe
 *  synchronization that requires that the render cache and/or depth
 *  related caches are flushed to memory, where the data will become
 *  globally visible. This type of synchronization is required prior to
 *  SW (CPU) actually reading the result data from memory, or initiating
 *  an operation that will use as a read surface (such as a texture
 *  surface) a previous render target and/or depth/stencil buffer
 *
 * From Haswell PRM, volume 2, part 1, "End-of-Pipe Synchronization":
 *
 *  Exercising the write cache flush bits (Render Target Cache Flush
 *  Enable, Depth Cache Flush Enable, DC Flush) in PIPE_CONTROL only
 *  ensures the write caches are flushed and doesn't guarantee the data
 *  is globally visible.
 *
 *  SW can track the completion of the end-of-pipe-synchronization by
 *  using "Notify Enable" and "PostSync Operation - Write Immediate
 *  Data" in the PIPE_CONTROL command.
