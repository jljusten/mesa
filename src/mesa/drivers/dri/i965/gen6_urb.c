/**
 * The following diagram shows how we partition the URB on Sandybridge:
 *
 *           URB size / 2                   URB size / 2
 *   _____________-______________   _____________-______________
 *  /                            \ /                            \
 * +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 * | Vertex Shader Entries        | Geometry Shader Entries      |
 * +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * Currently we split the URB space evenly between the VS and the GS.
 * This is not ideal (especially when we're not using GS), but simple.
 *
 * Sandybridge GT1 has 32kB of URB space, while GT2 has 64kB.
 * (See the Sandybridge PRM, Volume 2, Part 1, Section 1.4.7: 3DSTATE_URB.)
